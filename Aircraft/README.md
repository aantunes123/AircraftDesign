### Class Aircraft
In this class the user will find the methods responsible to create the aircraft geometry
compute the weight, the drag, the performance and the flight mechanics. This methods are
called in the aircraft_setup.py which the main part of the code. The important methods on
this class are:

``` 
Compute_Geometry
``` 

``` 
Compute_Weight
``` 

``` 
Compute_Drag
``` 

``` 
Compute_Performance
``` 

``` 
Compute_Flight_Mechanics
```
