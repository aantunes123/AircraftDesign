### Class Aircraft
In this class the user will find the methods responsible to create the aircraft geometry and compute the weight, the drag, the performance and the flight mechanics. These methods can be called on the aircraft_setup.py which consits the main interface with the user. It is on this code (aircraft_setup.py) that the user will mount its optimization problem. The important methods on this class are: 

``` 
Compute_Geometry
``` 

``` 
Compute_Weight
``` 

``` 
Compute_Drag
``` 

``` 
Compute_Performance
``` 

``` 
Compute_Flight_Mechanics
```
