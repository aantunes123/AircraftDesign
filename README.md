# Build and Installation Instructions for AircraftDesign

### INTRODUCTION

  This is a collaborative environment focused in preliminary aircraft design. The environment consider different aeronautical disciplines and consists in an initiative towards a open tool for the students.

### LICENSE

Permissions of this strongest copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and          modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. When a modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the complete source code of the modified version must be made available.   

The present implementation relies on a variety of libraries and package. Bellow the dependecies that must be available on your computer.

### DEPENDENCIES

- [Python](http://www.python.org) - Scripting language.  Optional dependency required if building Python API module.

- [Nympy](http://www.numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
	
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

- [PythonOCC](http://www.pythonocc.org/download/) - OCC library that is responsible to render the aircraft components.

### Rendering Using Python_OCC
